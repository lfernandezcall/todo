This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## How to run it

First you need to run npm install in the working directory

### If you are in branch *part-1*

Here I made a development with a node server, you will find two folders, "client" and "server". In order to run the client side you must run *npm start* from Terminal inside the "client" directory and for the server, go to the "server" folder and from the Terminal run *node server.js*

In this branch I made some styles also

### If you are in branch *part-2* or *part-3*

In these two branches the folder structure is more simpler, the data persist after refreshing because of *localStorage*. In order to run the project inside the main directory run from the terminal npm start
